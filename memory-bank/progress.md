# Progress Log
Chronological notes of major milestones and decisions.

- What currently works:
  - Basic project structure with client/server separation
  - Zillow API integration via RapidAPI proxy (propertyExtendedSearch endpoint)
  - Server-side LLM support using OpenRouter API with Claude-3-Haiku model
  - LLM-powered natural language prompt parsing into structured filter criteria
  - React frontend with conversational search interface (ConversationInterface component)
  - Traditional filter controls (location, price range, property type, beds/baths, sqft, sort)
  - Active filters display with square sage-green styling positioned above results count
  - Property search and display with card-based UI
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and custom color scheme
  - Server-side API key management and request proxying
  - Data normalization for consistent property object structure
  - Error handling for API failures
  - Code cleanup: removed unused ActiveFiltersBar component and related functions
  - Multi-turn dialogue support with conversation history and context-aware responses
  - Integrated conversation interface with auto-scroll functionality
  - Dual filter control synchronization: conversation and traditional filters stay in sync
  - Filter change highlighting: newly modified filters pulse with visual feedback
  - Location preservation in multi-turn conversations: location persists unless explicitly changed
  - Consistent UI typography: Conversation and Advanced Filters headers match in size

- Whatâ€™s left to build:
  - Enhanced UI to support both conversational and traditional filter controls
  - User experience improvements (loading states, empty states, error states)
  - Testing (unit tests, integration tests for API endpoints)

- Known issues:
  - Limited error handling and user feedback in UI
  - No validation for filter inputs or API responses
