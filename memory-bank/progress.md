# Progress Log
Chronological notes of major milestones and decisions.

- What currently works:
  - Basic project structure with client/server separation
  - Zillow API integration via RapidAPI proxy (propertyExtendedSearch endpoint)
  - React frontend with filter controls (location, price range, property type, beds/baths, sqft, sort)
  - Property search and display with card-based UI
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and custom color scheme
  - Server-side API key management and request proxying
  - Data normalization for consistent property object structure
  - Error handling for API failures

- Whatâ€™s left to build:
  - Conversational search interface with natural language input
  - LLM integration for parsing natural language prompts into filter criteria
  - Multi-turn dialogue support for iterative search refinement
  - Active filter state display and transparency features
  - Enhanced UI to support both conversational and traditional filter controls
  - User experience improvements (loading states, empty states, error states)
  - Testing (unit tests, integration tests for API endpoints)

- Known issues:
  - No conversational features implemented yet (core project requirement)
  - Limited error handling and user feedback in UI
  - No validation for filter inputs or API responses

- Status updates (with dates if possible):
  - 2025-09-24: Memory Bank initialized with current project state
  - 2025-09-24: Identified port configuration issue between client and server
  - 2025-09-24: Confirmed basic Zillow API integration working but conversational features missing
  - Project appears to be in early MVP stage with foundation laid but core conversational features not yet implemented
