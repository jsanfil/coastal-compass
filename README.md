# Coastal Compass

A full-stack web application that provides a **conversational, natural-language experience** for searching residential real estate. Users can describe what they're looking for in plain English, and the system translates those prompts into structured search criteria, fetches matching listings via the Zillow API, and displays results in a modern, responsive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational Search**: Describe your dream home in natural language (e.g., "Show me 3-bedroom homes near La Jolla under $2M with ocean views")
- **LLM-Powered Parsing**: Advanced language model integration to understand and process user prompts into precise filter criteria
- **Multi-turn Dialogue**: Refine your search through conversational follow-ups (e.g., "Make it 4 bedrooms instead")
- **Filter Transparency**: Always see the current active filters being applied, adjustable through both conversation and traditional UI controls
- **Zillow API Integration**: Real-time access to comprehensive real estate data via RapidAPI proxy
- **Modern UI**: Responsive, accessible design built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Advanced Filtering**: Traditional controls for price range, property type, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and sorting options

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client** (`/client`): React application built with Vite, featuring a modern UI for property search and display
- **Server** (`/server`): Node.js Express server that handles API requests and communicates with RapidAPI Zillow endpoints

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this application, you'll need:

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **RapidAPI Account** with access to the Zillow API
3. **RapidAPI Key** for authentication

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsanfil/coastal-compass.git
   cd coastal-compass
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Install client dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** with your RapidAPI credentials:
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
   RAPIDAPI_HOST=zillow-com1.p.rapidapi.com
   ZILLOW_SEARCH_PATH=/search
   PORT=3001
   ```

   Replace `your_rapidapi_key_here` with your actual RapidAPI key.

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client will run on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar Vite dev server port)

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the client URL to start searching for properties!

## 🧪 Testing

**Server tests:**
```bash
cd server
npm test
